My name is David Persico and I worked with Jarrod Raine. As I am Linux native and couldn't install Unity.
Now I have a VR capable windows 10 laptop, so I can work more independently in the future and rent out VR equipment.
The final game:
Has a color changing large ball target.
The goals is to hit the large target ball with one of the small red projectile balls.
The balls bounce off the target and it moves to a new spot around the player.
The ground is grass and the large ball casts a shadow onto it.
